# tools/precommit.sh — native, tool-independent self-check.
#
# Run by .git/hooks/pre-commit (and safe to run by hand or in CI). It proves the
# toolchain still BUILDS and SELF-HOSTS CORRECTLY at every optimization level
# before a commit is allowed — this is exactly the class of bug that a plain
# `-O1`-only bootstrap missed once (a compiler built at `-O2` silently
# miscompiled itself while `-O0`/`-O1` were fine).
#
# DELIBERATELY NATIVE-ONLY (x86_64): every check here runs on any machine with no
# external tools, so the verdict is identical everywhere. Cross-compilation
# checks (aarch64/qemu, windows/wine, C-interop/gcc) are environment-dependent
# and therefore live in tools/check-cross.sh, which NEVER gates a commit.
#
# It tests the WORKING TREE (what you'd get after the commit), building from
# source into a scratch dir — it never mutates tracked files or ./caustic.
#
# Skip:   PRECOMMIT_SKIP=1 git commit ...      (or  git commit --no-verify)
# Force:  PRECOMMIT_FULL=1  tools/precommit.sh  (run even with no .cst staged)
